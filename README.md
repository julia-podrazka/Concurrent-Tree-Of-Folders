# Concurrent-Tree-Of-Folders

Implementation of a concurrent data structure representing a tree of folders. 
Allowed operations on a tree: creating a new tree with an empty subfolder "/", removing a tree, printing contents of a folder, creating a new subfolder with a given path, removing a folder if it's empty, moving a folder with its contents to another folder if it's possible.
